strategy to solve the problem
    #why:
        #because we have n + 1 int in range [1, n] and only on repeat. Therefore, it is a linked list problem and we do not have node with value 0.
        #this is a linked list problem nums[index] equal to node.next
        #using floyd algorithm to find duplicate
            #find first meet node with slow and fast
            #find the second meet. and this is duplicate value
