#problem understanding
    #You are given an array of strings tokens that represents an arithmetic expression in a Reverse Polish Notation.
    #Evaluate the expression. Return an integer that represents the value of the expression.

#strategy to solve the problem
    #using stack because we can take two most recent number
        #operation is do by sequence, result of the last operation will be append to stack and then continue
    #check for operator character to do the operation
    #if character is not operator just append number
    #return is the last remaining number in the stack
    #variable:
        #stack to keep track of the two most recent numbers from tokes string
